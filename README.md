# Portfolio Site
## About
This Webpage displays a portfolio of my projects. It is basically a conversion of the design mockup given over [here](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/November/5a136147_design-mockup-portfolio/design-mockup-portfolio.pdf) to a full-fledged Webpage. 

It has been developed as part of Udacity's [Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree](https://in.udacity.com/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd004).
